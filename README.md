### General Information
This project was very simple for my skillset right now. Theres a button with an event that creates an element, adds a class to that element, then appends it to the html document. It takes a random message from a messages array, and returns them as innerText in the new element. Lastly I created a timeout function that removes the created element after 3 seconds.

### Takeaways
This was more practice than learning anything new. I have taken a couple days off, so this was a nice refresher.
